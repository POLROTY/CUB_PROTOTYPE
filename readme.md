JavaScript is a great choice for starting a raycasting project because it is a widely-used, versatile programming language
 that can be run on a variety of platforms. It is easy to learn and has a large community of developers who can provide support 
 and resources. Additionally, JavaScript has a number of powerful libraries (we will use p5 here) and frameworks, such as three.js, 
 that can be used to create complex, interactive graphics with minimal code. This makes it a great choice for creating a raycasting 
 project, as it allows for fast development and easy implementation of new features.
