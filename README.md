Raycasting Prototype using JavaScript:


This project is a prototype for a raycasting engine, implemented using JavaScript.
The goal was to quickly test and refine the concepts and algorithms involved in a raycasting engine, 
and JavaScript was chosen for its ease of use and quick prototyping capabilities.


Simple and efficient implementation of the raycasting algorithm
Dynamic wall and floor rendering
Basic support for textures and wall height variations
Keyboard controls for player movement and rotation


To run the prototype, simply open the index.html file in your browser. The controls are as follows:

W/A/S/D - move forward, left, back, right respectively
Arrow keys - rotate the player's view


JavaScript proved to be a great choice for quickly prototyping the concepts involved in a raycasting engine.
The language's simplicity and versatility allowed for a fast iteration and testing process,
which was essential in developing a solid understanding of the underlying algorithms.

I later made a CUB3D version in C that adds map and texture entries to the game.
